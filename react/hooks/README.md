# React Hooks

Hooks allows a component to "hook" to additional functions. Here are the built-in react hook types:

| Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| State hooks       | Allow components to remember a state. Useful in user inputs.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Context hooks     | Allow components to receive info from distant parents without passing it as props.                                                                                                                                 |
| Effect hooks      | Allow components to connect and synchronize with external systems eg. network, browser DOM, animations, or UI components written with a different framework.  It's part of the React paradigm called escape hatch. |
| Ref hooks         | Allow components to hold some info that isn't use for rendering, aka refs. Unlike state hooks, updating a ref doesn't re-render the components.  It's part of the React paradigm called escape hatch.              |
| Performance hooks | Allow components to optimize re-rendering performance by reusing a cached calculated value, skipping an expensive, unnecessary workload, etc.                                                                      |
| Other hooks       | Other built-in hooks.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
