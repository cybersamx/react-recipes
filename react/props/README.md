# React Props

An example on passing props to React components.

Props are things that are passed to a React component. Props can be JavaScript values, functions, objects, and JSX components (single, nested component with children, etc).

## Prop Types

Since we are using TypeScript in this project, we have 2 ways to define prop types:

* Use `PropTypes` from the `prop-types` package.
* Use TypeScript to define the prop type. _We will use this approach to define the prop types._

## Setup

1. Run the application.

   ```shell
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

1. Navigate to <http://localhost:3000>.
